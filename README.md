We have developed a Smart Attendance System that automatically updates your attendance. We have used and configured RFID tags that alert the user with a buzzer sound once the attendance has been marked and our Face Recognition model uses Machine Learning concepts to capture the face and recognize it when in zone.<br>
Our project involves both the usage of hardware in the form of RFID tags configured to the user along with Face Recognition.<br>
Some features our project offers are:
1. The usage of both RFID tags and Face Recognition prevents the human errors as well as proxy attendances.
2. We use google sheets to save our data.
3. The google sheet is automatically updated once a person marks their attendance allowing for a large dataset to be included.
4. The google sheet is configured as to automatically update the time and date of the attendance.
5. A single user cannot mark attendance more than once in a day hence preventing redundancy.
